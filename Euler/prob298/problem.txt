Selective Amnesia

Both players, Larry and Robin, can remember only a maximum of five numbers from a random
sequence containing the numbers 1 to 10 inclusive.

When a number is in their memory, that person gets a point

If not, each has a strategy:

Larry forgets the number said farthest in the past.

Robin forgets the number that has been in memory for the most turns.

Determine the expected difference of score between both players after 50 turns.
